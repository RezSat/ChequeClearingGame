so here is the idea, Simulator of the day of the clearing department
both have sinhla and enlgish subs
Initial window:
    button saying "Initiate Day Start Function"
    background moving things like "3116", "3118", "Sam33ra", "Malli"
    topic: Cooparate Branch, clearing department

press the button select the task:

    tas: -> Enter Chques
            -> select character
        -> Scan Cheques
         -> select character ( here it's called the Scanning Deyyo/Scanning god)

characters have different strengths and weaknesses
available characters:
    -> Yehan
    -> Yuresh
    -> Randira

Auditors:
    Sam33ra Sir (S sir)
    Nandani Miss (N miss)

NPC: Dilanka Miss ( D miss )

Unit Head: Sandareka ( Doing nothing that involve much, signing some cheques and basically not involing much in it)

enter cheques: option with a character, repair batches screen and then basically the same as image master
there will be some batches that auto generating and some of them will be uppdated automatically while you enter the selected batch
of yours

print option
then put into an Auditor

when putting it to an audior if the batch balances that audior has to audit is greater than the other and that is for N miss then 
a blaming message will be shown.

while auditing, there will be more batches, that we can enter, and if we did nothing when there are more than 3 batches in the list
dilanka miss will shout "Malli batch gahanna nikn inne"

we can select a either month end or normal day only difference is that at month end there are god damn lot of batches,

when all batches are finished, the day will end and the audit will be done.
then the day end Function is done.

message: Even if you survie this very very very poorly build simulation you could never hope to surive the real thing itself, and that'S
what i love about it. *Thanks for playing*

this kind of the basic outline of the simulation i want to build, i need a web based solution that is also mobile friendly what you think
